            are light non-alcoholic beverages made from one or more fruits,
            cereals, flowers, or seeds blended with sugar and water. They are
            popular in Mexico, Central America, and parts of the United States
            such as the Southwest. Some of the more common flavors include
            tamarind, hibiscus, and horchata.

            There is some confusion in terms internationally between the drinks
            referred to here and bottled soft drinks. In Guatemala and
            Nicaragua, these are referred to as "frescos", short for "refresco",
            which in Mexico means soft drinks. Soft drinks in Guatemala are
            called "aguas", short for aguas gaseosas, but easily confused with
            the Mexican aguas frescas.

          <h2>Horchata - $1.48</h2>
          <p>
            is a name given to various kinds of plant milk beverages of similar
            taste and appearance. It originated at least as far back as
            13th-century Valencia, where it is known as orxata de xufa. In Spain
            it is made with soaked, ground, and sweetened tiger nuts, but in
            Mexico and other parts of the Americas the base is white rice.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a term related to a Mediterranean tradition of grain-based
            beverages and also the linguistic root of orgeat syrup. The
            Valencian or Chufa horchata is made with dried and sweetened tiger
            nuts. By the 11th century it had spread to Hispania with the Muslim
            presence. There are 13th-century records of a horchata-like beverage
            made near Valencia.
