            are made of fresh fruit that’s typically cubed or cut into long
            spears, stacked into clear plastic cups and topped with Tajin chile
            lime seasoning, chamoy sauce and lime juice.

            This snack is everywhere in Mexico, especially in outdoor markets
            where fruit vendors are on every corner. It’s super simple to make,
            is the perfect little snack on a hot sunny day and is fairly healthy
            considering the main ingredient is fruit!

          <p>
            are a tasty treat, and yet they are something that hasn’t really
            gained much popularity in the US. It’s a traditional Latin America
            street food that is most common in Mexico, but can easily be made at
            home.

            Usually, jicama is cut into thick slices and then skewered. It’s
            sprinkled with lime juice and rolled in flavorings. It can be
            something simple like chili or something extra tart like orange,
            grape, strawberry — all of which have a little heat to them as well.
